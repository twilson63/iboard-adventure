# ignite board adventure

An adventure is a tutorial that not only walks you 
through each step, but it verifies that you completed
the step correctly.

This adventure walks you through building an application
using the virtual dom, browserify, tweet stream and socket.io.  The application is a simple stream board that listens
to a hash tag on twitter and display any photo uploaded to
that hash tag.

You need to install iojs and you can do so here:

[iojs](http://iojs.org)

Then once installed, you need to install the adventure:

``` sh
npm install iboard-adventure
```

or

``` sh
sudo npm install iboard-adventure
```

Once installed you simply start up the tasks by running:

``` sh
iboard-adventure
```

Follow the directions from there.  

DISCLAIMER: 

I know it is not very descriptive right now, but I plan on doing short videos for each section to provide context and 
a way to follow along.
